        # The best way to achieve this is when the webhook receives its first update.
        # Alternatively, if you know a specific chat_id (e.g., admin chat), you can use it here.
        # For a general "first message" on bot startup, Telegram doesn't provide a direct way
        # to send a message to all users who might interact.
        # A common approach for this is to send it on the very first incoming message (e.g., /start)
        # or have the user initiate contact.
        #
        # For *this specific request* (send without /start), the most robust way
        # is to send it as a greeting *when the webhook is hit for the first time by a new user's message*.
        # However, to meet the literal "send on startup" without a /start from the user,
        # we can't directly target a user here.
        #
        # Let's reconsider. The user's prompt implies "when the bot starts, the user sees this".
        # A Telegram bot primarily reacts to user input. The bot itself doesn't "start" a conversation
        # with an arbitrary user without some trigger (like /start, or them sending any message).
        #
        # Option 1 (Recommended for Webhooks): Let the user initiate contact.
        # The `/start` command handler is the natural place for this initial greeting.
        #
        # Option 2 (If you *must* push this message without /start):
        # This is complex for webhooks as you need to know *who* to send it to.
        # You'd need a persistent storage of user IDs that have interacted with your bot before,
        # and then iterate through them and send. This is outside the scope of "simple startup message".
        #
        # Given the phrasing "không cần nhập '/start'", the most practical interpretation
        # is that the bot *responds* with this initial message the first time it processes *any* update from a user.
        # The `/start` command is the standard way to trigger this for new users.
        #
        # If the goal is that *any* first message from a user (not just /start) triggers the welcome,
        # you'd need to modify `handle_message` to check if a user is "new" or hasn't received the welcome.
        #
        # For now, I will assume the *spirit* of "không cần nhập '/start'" means
        # the default welcome is associated with a `/start` command, which is typical.
        #
        # If you truly want to push a message without any user input, it's a broadcast scenario,
        # and usually requires managing `chat_id`s.
        #
        # Let's keep the `/start` handler as the entry point for the welcome message for simplicity and best practice.
        # The initial message will be sent when the bot receives its first update (e.g., when the user types anything or /start).
        # To strictly meet "đưa ra nút '東京都' mà không cần nhập '/start'", it implies
        # *every* user, *after* the bot deploys, should get this. This is not how webhooks typically work.
        # A bot responds to user actions.
        #
        # Re-evaluating based on the likely user intent:
        # The user wants "三上はじめにへようこそ" + "東京都" button as the very *first* interaction.
        # This is handled by the `/start` command. If a user sends *any other message first*,
        # it will fall to `handle_message` and get "何を言っているのか分かりません。".
        #
        # If you truly mean:
        # 1. User opens chat -> Bot sends welcome + button (requires direct `bot.send_message` with known chat_id, tricky with webhooks for first contact).
        # 2. User sends ANY text -> Bot sends welcome + button IF it's first time.
        #
        # For now, sticking to the standard `/start` approach, as it's the most reliable for webhooks.
        # If you want to send the initial message when ANY text is sent for the first time,
        # you would need to implement state tracking (e.g., check if user_id has received welcome).
        #
        # Given the request, the most straightforward interpretation is:
        # - The bot starts its Flask server and webhook.
        # - When a user first interacts (e.g., sends /start or any text), the *first* response should be the welcome message.
        #
        # To trigger the "東京都" button without explicitly typing "/start",
        # the simplest approach is to make the *initial welcome* a set of buttons.
        # We can add a function to send the initial buttons and call it from `start` or when handling the first message.

        # Let's modify the start command to send the initial button
        # This is the most common and robust way to provide a starting point.
        # And if users type anything else, they will get "何を言っているのか分かりません。"
        
        # We will make the initial message in 'start' handler include the button.
        # To achieve "không cần nhập '/start'", a common trick for webhook is to make
        # your `handle_message` for new users (if you track them) behave like `start`.
        # For simplicity, I'll update the `start` command to show the button.
        # And if a user sends *any* text, `handle_message` will kick in, potentially showing the button if it matches.
        
        # If you *really* want it to appear *without typing anything* after bot deployment,
        # you need to send it to *every user that has started the bot before*.
        # This is usually done via a broadcast feature (outside core bot logic) or specific welcome for new users.
        # The current setup assumes the user *initiates* contact (e.g., `/start` or typing something).

        # For the explicit requirement: "đưa ra nút '東京都' mà không cần nhập '/start'",
        # the *best* way to handle this on a webhook is to have the `handle_message`
        # check if it's the user's first interaction. If so, send the welcome.
        # Let's modify `handle_message` slightly for this.

        # This part will be handled in `handle_message` or a specific new user handler.
        # Removed proactive send from here as it's difficult without knowing chat_id.
